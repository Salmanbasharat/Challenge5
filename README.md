## **OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS**
The ride sharing data has been reframed and arranged to see the fares by each city type i.e *Urban*, *Suburban* and *Rural*. Earlier the data was analysed on each city itself like Port Angela, Rodneyfort etc but now management want to see the Fares trend on weekly basis in the "Type" of cities so that they can use the analysis to make their business decisions. We have used Python and Pandas to analyse the data and Matplotlib to visualize it.
## **RESULTS**
The analysis of ride sharing data on the basis of *City Types* tells us that the number of *Total Rides*, *Total Drivers* and *Total Fares* in these city types are in following order:

**Urban**

**Suburban**

**Rural**

Which means Urban areas have most Rides, Drivers and Fares and Rural have the least, however when we see the *Average Fares per Driver* and *Average Fare per Ride* then the order reverses and Rural have the highest averages and Urban the lowest. This fact is shown in below picture.

## **SUMMARY**
This is evident from our analysis that though the overall revenue is higher in high denisty areas like urban and Suburban but average Fare per ride and per driver is highest in Rural areas. In light of this, below reccomendations are made for the ride sharing company:

1- If we see the data we learn that number of rides in urban areas are much lesser than the number of drivers which may indicate that drivers remain unoccupied and are not contributing in generating business for the firm. The similar statistics in Suburban and rural areas show that the number of drivers are lesser than the rides which means each driver is getting more than one ride. For the same reason, the average fare per driver in Urban areas is very low. The firm should look into it and find a away to either rationalize the number of drivers in Urban areas or form a strategy that they should get more rides.

2- The number of drivers in Rural areas are quite low. We know from the data that there are relatively longer distances in rural areas which means each driver is occupied for a longer time and cant serve potential customers during occupied time hence the firm should think on hiring more drivers in Rural areas to serve more customers.

3- The analysis of weekly data across all type of cities reveal that the pattern of getting business is more or less same across the board hence the management should focus on optimising the number of drivers and ensure that they get maximum rides to increase overall revenue for the firm and for themselves.
